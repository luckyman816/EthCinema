# ETHCinemaNation

ETHCinemaNation is a blockchain-based voting system that allows users to vote for their favorite movies and TV series. The system is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to ensure the integrity of the voting process.

Users can browse the list of movies and TV series, and select the one they want to vote for. Each user is only allowed to vote once per movie or TV series. The voting data is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and is tamper-proof.

The system also includes a leaderboard that displays the top voted movies and TV series. The leaderboard is updated in real-time as new votes come in.

To use the system, users must have a Metamask wallet and some Ether. Users can vote by sending a small amount of Ether to the smart contract address associated with the movie or TV series they want to vote for. The smart contract automatically records the vote and updates the vote count for the corresponding movie or TV series.

Overall, ETHCinemaNation provides a transparent and secure way for movie and TV series enthusiasts to vote for their favorite shows, and for content creators to get valuable feedback on their work.
