# ETHCinemaNation

ETHCinemaNation is a blockchain-based voting system that allows users to rate their favorite movies and TV series. Built on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts, the system ensures the integrity of the rating process.

Users can explore a wide selection of movies and TV series and provide their ratings. Each user is limited to one rating per movie or TV series. The ratings are securely recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, guaranteeing their immutability.

The platform features a dynamic leaderboard that showcases the top-rated movies and TV series in real-time as new ratings are submitted.

To participate, users need a Metamask wallet and some Ether. By sending a small amount of Ether to the smart contract associated with their chosen movie or TV series, users can cast their ratings. The smart contract automatically updates the rating and calculates the average rating for each movie or TV series.

ETHCinemaNation offers a transparent and reliable solution for movie and TV enthusiasts to express their opinions, while providing valuable feedback to content creators.
